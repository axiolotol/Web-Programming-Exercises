                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Set in the utopian city of Piltover and the oppressed underground of Zaun, Arcane follows the origins of two iconic League champions and the power that will tear them apart. The story focuses on the relationship between sisters Vi and Powder (later known as Jinx) as they find themselves on opposing sides of a brewing conflict between the two cities.</p>

            <div class="plot-act">
                <h3>Act 1: Origins</h3>
                <p>The series begins with a failed uprising in Zaun that leaves Vi and her younger sister Powder orphaned. They are taken in by Vander, the leader of the undercity. Years later, Vi, Powder, and their friends Mylo and Claggor attempt a heist in Piltover that goes wrong when they discover valuable magical gemstones. Their actions draw the attention of Piltover's enforcers and scientists Jayce and Viktor, who are researching dangerous arcane magic.</p>
                
                <p>As tensions escalate, Vander is captured by Silco, a crime lord with a vision for Zaun's independence. Vi leads a rescue mission, but a traumatized Powder, trying to help, inadvertently causes an explosion that kills Mylo, Claggor, and apparently Vander. Devastated, Vi lashes out at Powder before being captured by enforcers, leaving Powder to be taken in by Silco.</p>

                <h3>Act 2: Evolution</h3>
                <p>Years later, Powder has transformed into the unstable criminal Jinx, while Vi remains imprisoned. Jayce has successfully harnessed arcane magic through Hextech, revolutionizing Piltover. The technology's potential for weaponization creates political tensions within the city's council.</p>
                
                <p>Vi is freed by Enforcer Caitlyn Kiramman, and together they venture into the undercity to find Jinx and evidence against Silco. Meanwhile, Viktor's deteriorating health leads him to dangerous experimentation with Hextech and the mysterious Hexcore.</p>

                <h3>Act 3: Resolution</h3>
                <p>As Piltover and Zaun stand on the brink of war, Vi and Jinx reunite, but their relationship is complicated by years of trauma and Jinx's loyalty to Silco. The Council of Piltover votes for independence for Zaun, but Silco's death at Jinx's hands threatens the fragile peace.</p>
                
                <p>In a final act of chaos, Jinx launches a Hextech-powered rocket at the Council building during their vote for peace, cementing her transformation and the inevitable conflict between the two citiesâ€”and between the two sisters.</p>
